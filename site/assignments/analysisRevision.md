You are expected to revise all major writing assignments in this class.

After turning in your rhetorical analysis, you will be given a grade along with three revision goals. For this assignment, you are asked to seriously and thoroughly revise your paper based on those goals. You must also correct any errors in citation and formatting.

You should turn in a revised essay with a cover page that has the following elements:
* Name (upper left corner)
* Date (upper left corner)
* Rhetoric 309k (upper left corner)
* Running Head (short title, all caps, in header)
* Title: top center
* Essay subtitle: "Revision"
* A brief description of your three revision goals (you can copy from my e-mail).
* For each revision goal, several sentences describing your efforts to meet your revision goal.  

##Evaluation
You will be evaluated based exclusively on your ability to meet the three revision goals. While some goals may be fairly straightforward or minor ("Revise the wording in your introduction"), overall you are expected to make significant changes to your original paper in order to achieve these goals.

Failure to correct formatting or citation errors will result in a 10-point deducation from your final grade.
