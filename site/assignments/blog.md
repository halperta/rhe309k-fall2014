##General
How do you ethically inform a general audience about the controversy that you have been researching? [Unit 3](unit3.html) asks you to build a portfolio of articles about science for different publication contexts. In each case, you should be writing about your chosen controversy, providing information about the studies that you have focused on, and taking a position related to your controversy. That position may be research-based  ("current research is inadequate"), it may be knowledge based ("thanks to research, we know that..."), or it may be policy-based ("based on current research, our best course of action is to...").

In this assignment, you will write an 650-900 word blog post for a popular news venue like CNN, BBC, Fox News, etc. First, you are asked to complete a [style worksheet]({{ page.root }}documents/styleWorksheet.docx) for your chosen news venue.
