In this unit, we will focus on “science writing” as a genre that attempts to bridge the gap between scientific and popular discourse. We will read and evaluate articles across the science-writing spectrum, examining the ill-cited and the heavily researched; the bare-boned and the artfully constructed. We will collectively evaluate the credibility of these different ways of writing, and break down the secrets to their stylistic success.

Having established expertise in your research topic through extensive research, in Unit 3, you will continue developing your science writing portfolio by writing journalistic pieces about your scientific controversy. These pieces will be directed at four different forums:
•	Op-ed: The opinion section of a peer-reviewed journal like Science
•	Feature: A popular scientific magazine like Wired
•	Presentation: A popular radio show like RadioLab

You will complete this unit with a clear understanding of popular scientific writing styles and the skills required to produce writing for multiple forums. You will leave the course with a portfolio of writing clips in the genre of popular science.
