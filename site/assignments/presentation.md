##Assignment Overview
In this four to five minute presentation, you will argue for a single position in your controversy. You can use any strategy that you like to try to make your argument, but you must include at least one emotional appeal, and you must refer to at least one scientific study. You must also refute at least one opposing argument.  

You may choose to give your presentation as a narrative, focused on what you have learned or what the person you interviewed learned or discovered. Or you may choose to do it as an informative presentation, providing information and promoting a point of view.  

It is strongly recommended, but not required, that you use visuals. If you do choose to use a visual aid, you can upload it in advance to the RHE309k Dropbox Folder.

* Coherence and effectiveness of emotional appeals
* Coherence and effectiveness of logical appeals
* Overall clarity of argument
* Effectiveness of performance (clarity, engagement, confidence)
* Effectiveness of visuals (if using)
