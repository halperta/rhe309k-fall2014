This graded assignment asks you to conduct a careful analysis of a scientific article, evaluating both the scientific content of the article, and its writing.  

##Specifics
In this assignment you are asked to read the article:

[Wakefield, A. J., Murch, S. H., Anthony, A., Linnell, J., Casson, D. M., Malik, M.,... Walker-Smith, J. A. (1998, February 28). Ileal-lymphoid nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children. *The Lancet, 351*, 637-641. Retrieved from www.sciencedirect.com](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673697110960)

You should then complete the [article analysis]({{ page.root }}/documents/articleAnalysis.docx). The assignment has been adapted from [an article by Jennifer Raff](http://violentmetaphors.com/2013/08/25/how-to-read-and-understand-a-scientific-paper-2/). 

You *are not expected to understand everything in the article.* You do not need to know exactly what patchy erythema, lymphoid nodular hyperplasia, or other specifics are. You should, however, know why the authors are looking at these things, and what finding them (or not) means for the study.

*You are not required to write complete paragraphs for each question*. Incomplete sentences and bullet points may be used when appropriate. However, you must write in "plain English" --- that is, when possible, you must translate the complex language of the article into a language that can be understood by a general public.


##Evalution
Your work will be evaluated on the follow criteria:
* Completion: Did you answer all the questions completely?
* Summary: Do you understand the main argument of the article?
* Methods: Do you demonstrate an understanding of the methods?
* Results: Were you able to filter through detailed information in order to identify key points? 
* Discussion: Do you show an understanding of the link between the study being conducted, and the claim(s) the authors are making? 
* Critique: Did you identify at least one potential critique of the article?
* Writing: Do you write in an appropriate style, using consistent grammar, spelling, and punctuation?
