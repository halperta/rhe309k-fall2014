For your rhetorical analysis, you will be asked to compare the persuasive strategies of two texts that take a position on your controversy. For this assignment, you are asked to complete the "science worksheet" worksheet for one of your chosen articles. Then, write a 300-350 word paper in which you analyze the article's use of rhetorical devices.

##Specifics
This research summary must be accompanied by a completed [Science Worksheet]({{ page.root }}documents/scienceWorksheet.docx) for your article.  

This research summary must include three sections:  

In the first section of your summary, *briefly* introduce the controversy and your chosen source.

In the second part of your summary, describe how your article uses science as a persuasive strategy (or not!), using 3-4 examples. Your subject for analysis might include the kinds of studies being cited, the language used to describe the studies, or the way that those studies are used to construct a logical argument. 

For each example, you'll need to both clearly describe the example (using quotes if necessary) and provide a hypothesis that explains the persuasive purpose of the example. Consider writing each paragraph in the form of a "quotation sandwich":
* Introduce your hypothesis
* Describe your example (with quotes as necessary)
* Interpret the example to explain how the article uses scientific discourse as a persuasive strategy.

To conclude, think briefly about the article more broadly. What does this analysis reveal about the article? About its position?


##Evalution
Your writing will be evaluated on the follow criteria:
* Clarity: is you argument clearly organized and articulated?
* Analysis: does the analysis show a sophisticated understanding of the rhetoric?
* Examples: do you provide clear and specific examples, using quotations when necessary?
* Writing: Do you write in an appropriate style, using consistent grammar, spelling, and punctuation? Is your essay the appropriate length?
