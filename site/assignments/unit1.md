Why do we think of science as being synonymous with truth, and what does scientific truth sound like? In this unit, we will address the nature of scientific truth by looking at the history of scientific discourse, from enlightenment classification systems to peer-reviewed research papers. We will specifically consider the nature of the scientific voice to understand where it gets its authority. And we will critique that voice, identifying how it obscures underlying ideologies, uncertainties, and sources of meaning.  

In Unit 1, you will be asked to select a current area of scientific research and to conduct a literature review based on this topic. In doing this project, the class will learn to evaluate the stylistic, rhetorical, and contextual differences between peer-reviewed articles in journals like Science and Nature; news sources like the New York Times or CNN; and opinionated writing around social controversies. You will be asked to think critically about questions of science, objectivity, and truth. In the end, you will write an analytic essay that compares rhetorical strategies in two types of articles.   

You will complete this unit with an understanding of how and where scientific research is published, and the critical skills to evaluate public discourse around science. You will also learn the basic research skills for conducting a literature review, and develop a confident academic writing voice.
