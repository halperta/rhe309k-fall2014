##General
For this assignment, you will conduct an interview (over e-mail) with a scientist at UT whose research is related to your field of study. For example, if you are researching climate change, you may choose to interview someone in geology who studies climate. Or you may choose to interview someone in engineering who studies alternative energy. You will then submit a transcript of your interview, with questions and a clean, readable version of the answers. 

##Specifics
###Choosing a scholar
You are expected to find a scientist at UT whose work relates to your area of study. This may be a professor, a postdoctoral student, or a graduate candidate (a PhD student in their final two years of research). If you want to interview someone who doesn't fit these characteristics (for example, someone at a different university), talk to me.

###Interview Preparation
Before conducting your interview, you are expected to submit the [interview preparation worksheet](prep.html), to be completed in class. You should have knowledge about the person you are interviewing, and a list of questions for the interview.

###Conducting the interview
You are advised to conduct the interview by e-mail. You may remain in contact with your interview subject throughout the course of this unit. Talk to me if you want to conduct an interview in person.  

You are advised to send a formal e-mail to schedule the interview by October 7.  

###Writing the interview

After conducting the interview, you need to format it for publication. This means that you will need to provide a title and a one or two paragraph introduction. Then you will list questions and provide the answers, correcting for grammar and spelling and editing for brevity.

##Evalution
Your interview will be evaluated on the following criteria (10 points each)
* Introduction: is your introduction engaging and clear? Does it provide the necessary background information?
* Questions: Are your questions appropriate? Do they tell a story? Do they address the interesting points of the controversy, and of the researcher's work?
* Answers: Are the answers effectively edited? Are they of an appropriate length? 
* Writing: Do you write in an appropriate style, using consistent grammar, spelling, and punctuation?
