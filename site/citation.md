##APA formatting
All graded assignments should be properly formatted according to APA standards.

Your essay should be typed on standard-sized paper (8.5" x 11") with 1" margins on all sides. You should use a clear font that is highly readable. APA recommends using 12 pt. Times New Roman font.

Include a page header  (also known as the "running head") at the top of every page. To create a page header/running head, insert page numbers flush right. Then type "TITLE OF YOUR PAPER" in the header flush left using all capital letters. The running head is a shortened version of your paper's title and cannot exceed 50 characters including spacing and punctuation. (cf: [Purdue OWL's APA general guidelines](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/).)

You do not need a title page. Use 1.5 spacing.

##APA in-text citations

See [Purdue OWL's guide to in-text citations.](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/02/)

All quotes or paraphrases must cite the author's last name, the date of publication, and the page number. Any information not included in the text goes immediately after the quotation.

	She stated, "Students often had difficulty using APA style" (Jones, 1998, p. 199), but she did not offer an explanation as to why.

###APA citations
For research summaries, citations should go immediately above the title. For all other work, references must go on a separate page at the end of the paper (please use a ["page break"](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/insert-a-page-break-HA010031062.aspx)).

Title the page "References".

All references should be single-spaced and alphabetized. The second line of the citation should be indented.

Titles of periodicals and volume numbers should be italicized.

###Punctuation
All punctuation goes inside quotation marks.
